# Definition of File-Base system

A collection of application programs that perform services for the end-users. Each program defines and manages its own data.

# Limitations of FIle-Base System (FbS)

1. Cannot deal with large mount of data 
2. concurrent access(invalid when multiple user visit FbS at the same time)
3. Data integrity issue: duplication of data, modify one file might affect other file. 
4. Program-data dependence
5. Ad-hoc queries are not welcome
6. Data security 
7. Crash recovery 

These problems arose because 
- definition of data was embedded in application programs, rather than being stored separately and independently. 
- No control over access and manipulation of data beyond that imposed by application programs. 


# Database

- Shared collection of logically related data 
- System catalog (metadata) provides description of data to enable program-data independence
- the logically related data comprises entities, attributes and relationships of an organization's info

# Database Management System (DBMS)

- A software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database
- Database application program: a computer program that interacts with database by issuing an appropriate request(SQL statement) to the DBMS

 > Advantages of Databases
 - Data independence 
 - Efficient data access 
 - Data integrity and security 
 - Redundancy management 
 - Concurrent access and recovery 
 - reduced application development time
 - Persistent storage 

# Database Approach 
> Data Definition Lanuage (DDL)
permit specification of data, structure and constraints
> Data manipulation Language (DML)
general enquiry facility (laguage) of the data 
> Data Control Laguage(DCL)

> Controlled access to database may include 
- security system 
- integrity system
- a concurrency control system 
- a recovery control system 
- a user-acccessible catalog

# Views

- allows users to have their own view of the database 
- essentially some subset of the database that reduce complexity 
- proivde a level of security 
- provide a mechanism to customize the appearance of the database 
- present a consistent, unchanging picture of the structure of the database, even if the underlying database if changed
