- All users should be able to access same data 
- Users should not need to know physical database storage details
- Internal structure of database should be unaffected by changes to physical aspects of storage 

# ANSI-SPARC 3-level architecture

## Intro of the three level Architecture


- External Level 
> User's view of the database 
> Describe that part of database that is relevant to a particular user 

- Conceptual Level 
> Describes what data is stored in database and relationships among the data

- Internal level 
> Describes how the data is stored in the database 

## Data Independence 

- Logical data independence 
> Refers to immunity of external schemas to changes in conceptual schema 


- Physical Data Independence 

> Refers to immunity of conceptual schema to changes in the internal schema
