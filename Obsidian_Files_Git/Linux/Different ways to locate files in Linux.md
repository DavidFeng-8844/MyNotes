If you don't know the full name of the file and you want to search for it in a directory with subfolders, you can use wildcard characters and other search options to help locate it. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Using the `find` Command with Wildcards**: You can use wildcard characters like `*` (matches any characters) and `?` (matches any single character) to search for files when you don't know their full names. For example, if you're looking for a file with "example" in its name:
    
  
    
    `find /path/to/start/search/from -type f -name "*example*"`
    
    This command will search for files with "example" anywhere in their names within the specified directory and its subdirectories.
    
2. **Using the `locate` Command with Wildcards**: The `locate` command can also be used with wildcards. For example, to search for files containing the word "searchword" in their name:
    
    
    
    `locate "*searchword*"`
    
    This command will find files with "searchword" anywhere in their names.
    
3. **Using `grep` to Search File Contents**: If you don't know the file name but you know what's inside the file, you can use `grep` to search for specific content within files:
    
   
    
    `grep -rl "search term" /path/to/start/search/from`
    
    This command will search for files containing the specified "search term" within the given directory and its subdirectories.
    

Remember to replace `/path/to/start/search/from` with the actual path where you want to begin your search and use appropriate wildcards or search terms to narrow down your search results. These methods will help you locate files even when you don't know their full names.
