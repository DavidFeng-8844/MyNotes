## Method


```JavaScript
// Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters

console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());

  

// Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.

console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());
```

## Review 

### Review

Let’s take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

- Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.
- We can write single-line [comments](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/comments) with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.
- There are 7 fundamental [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/data-types) in JavaScript: [strings](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/strings), numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
- Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`
- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`
- The built-in arithmetic [operators](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/operators) include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
- [Objects](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/objects), including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`.
- Objects, including instances of data types, can have [methods](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/methods) which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: `'hello'.toUpperCase()`.
- We can access properties and methods by using the `.`, dot operator.
- Built-in objects, including `Math`, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.
