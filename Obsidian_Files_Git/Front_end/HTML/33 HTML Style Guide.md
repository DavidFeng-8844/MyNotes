# For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.

# Using Style Sheey

```html
body {  background-color: lightgrey;  
  font-family: "Arial Black", Helvetica, sans-serif;  
  font-size: 16em;  
  color: black;}
```

- Place the opening bracket on the same line as the selector
- Use one space before the opening bracket
- Use two spaces of indentation
- Use semicolon after each property-value pair, including the last
- Only use quotes around values if the value contains spaces
- Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces

## Use Lower Case File Names

Some web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names: "london.jpg" cannot be accessed as "London.jpg".
