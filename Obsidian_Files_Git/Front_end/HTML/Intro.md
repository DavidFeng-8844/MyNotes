html讲网页基本内容的放置，比如标题，段落，链接等。css讲格式安排，比如字体大小，颜色，布局等。javascript是一段嵌入到网页里程序，完成用户登录信息，数据库连接和获取信息。


先找个简单例子，理解了再深入。

## Front end verse Back end 

### ==Front end:

Aspects of design that directly appear or relates to the browser like:
1. Graphic design 
2. Interfere design 
3. info design 

### ==Backend

Work on the server 
like:
1. Database Programming  


## Information design
One easily overlooked aspect of web design is information design, the organization
of content and how you get to it


## Interface design
If graphic design is concerned with how the page looks, interface design
focuses on how the page works like:
* buttons 
* links
* 
## Document Production 

Like writing markup language


==N.B. THe Word Wide Web Consortium==
The World Wide Web Consortium (called the W3C for short) is the organization
that oversees the development of web technologies.

## Scripting and Programming 

## ==HTML (Hyper text markup language)

(X)HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language, which
means it is a system for identifying and describing the various components of
a document such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.



## CSS

## JavaScript

Despite its name, JavaScript is not at all related to Java. JavaScript is a scripting
language that is used to add interactivity and behaviors to web pages,
including these (just to name a few):
Checking form entries for valid entries
Swapping out styles for an element or an entire site
Making the browser remember information about the user for the next
time they visit

## Server-side programming
Some web sites are collections of static (X)HTML documents and image files,
but most commercial sites have more advanced functionality such as forms
handling, dynamically generated pages, shopping carts, content management
systems, databases, and so on.

Applications
The latest web technique to create
a big stir is Ajax, which stands for
Asynchronous JavaScript and
XML.
