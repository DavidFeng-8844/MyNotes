The Internet is a network of connected computers

The World Wide Web (known affectionately as “the Web”) is just one of
the ways information can be shared over the Internet
>The Web uses a protocol
called HTTP ( HyperText Transfer Protocol).

>Each computer on the Internet is assigned a unique numeric ==IP address (IP
stands for Internet Protocol==

>Domain Name System (DNS) was developed that allows us to refer
to that server by its domain name

>The numeric IP address
is useful for computers, while the domain name is more accessible to humans.
Matching the text domain names to their respective numeric IP addresses is the
job of a separate DNS server.


## Intranets and Extranets

>Intranets :
>They are created and function like ordinary web sites, only they are on computers with special security devices (called firewalls) that prevent the outside world from seeing them

>Extranets:
> Like an Intranets but allows to select user from the outside of the company
