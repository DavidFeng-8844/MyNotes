When you delete a remote branch on GitHub, it doesn't automatically get deleted from your local repository. This is because Git allows you to keep references to remote branches even after they've been deleted on the remote repository. Local references to remote branches are useful in case you need to access or recover historical data from those branches.

To remove a local reference to a remote branch that has been deleted on the remote repository, you can use the `git fetch --prune` command. This command updates your remote-tracking branches (i.e., the references to remote branches) and removes any references that no longer exist on the remote repository. Here's how to use it:

```command  
git fetch --prune
```


```
rm -rf .git

```
