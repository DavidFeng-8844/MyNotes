## Key Characteristic 

1. Faster access time require more cost per bit 
2. Greater capacity implies slower access time 

## location 

## Capacity 

## Performance

1. Access time 
2. Memory Cycle time 
3. Transfer rate

## Access Method
1. ==Sequential Access== Start at the beginning of the memory and accesses records in order
	1. ==Direct access== move to a general region of memory (still depends on previous location)
2. ==Random Access== Directly address and access the selected memory address

## Physical Type 
1. Semiconductor storage like RAM USB 
2. Magnetic Storage 
3. optical storage

## Semiconductor Memory 

### RAM

1. Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
>Smaller, denser and less expensive 
1. Static RAM (SRAM)
less circuit and faster 

### ROM (Read only Memory )
> Permanent storage which cannot be changed 


## Error Detection and Correction 

1. Soft errors 
2. Hard Failures


## Parity bits 


### Redundancy for error checking


## Hamming Distance
