# Proof by Induction 

$\forall n ( P(n) \rightarrow P(n + 1)))$
Usually this means:
▶ We assume P(k) for a fixed but arbitary k.
This statement is the Inductive Hypothesis.
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Note that we only assume P(k) for a single k,
not for all k</mark> (because that’s what we want to
prove! )
▶ We use the assumption that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">P(k) in proving
P(k + 1).</mark>
This proof is the Inductive Step
