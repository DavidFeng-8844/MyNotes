# Matrices and vectors 

An m â‡¥ n matrix can represent a function from $R^n$ to $R^m$ . 

>if A is a matrix we use Aij to denote the real number which
appears in the ith row and jth column of A.
## Operations 

>Addition:
>If A and B are matrices where
A has the same number of rows as B, say m,
and A has the same number of columns as B, say n,
then A+B is the m by n matrix defined by (A+B)ij = Aij +Bij .

>Multiplication: 
>If A is an m by n matrix, and B is an n by p matrix, then AB is
the m by p matrix given by:
$\add 

>Properties

Commutative except for the multiplication:

AB $\neq$ BA 
$$\begin{matrix}
1 & b \\
2 & 3 \\

\end{matrix}$$




>Zero Matrix 


>Identity Matrix
