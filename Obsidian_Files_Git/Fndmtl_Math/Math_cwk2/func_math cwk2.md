The answer above tries to prove by $x$ is not odd(even) $\rightarrow$ $x^2$ is even which can only prove that $x^2$ is odd implies $x$ is odd but can't prove $x$,   $x \in N$ is odd $iff$ $x^2$ is odd. 
To fully prove it by contraposition, it should be broken it into two steps, first $x^2$ is odd implies $x$ is odd, and prove $x$ is odd implies $x^2$ is odd.  
So we need to add the second step. The contrapositive of the second statement is if $x^2$ is not odd(even), then $x$ is not odd(even). To do it, we should first assume $x \in N$, $x^2 = 4k^2$ is even, $x = 2k$ is even.
