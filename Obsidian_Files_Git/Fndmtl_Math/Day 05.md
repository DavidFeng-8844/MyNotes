Names for Mathematical Statements 

* Theorem : something known to be true 
* Lemma a small key step towards satisfying something 
* proposition: Something known to be true
* axiom assumed and used as basis for furter deeuctions 
* Euclid famously gave some axioms for geometry
* conjecture could be true but there is no konwn proff 
* Corollary: follows quickly from something earlier 
* 




>Type of proff 

>>direct 



>>indirect


Proof by  <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">contraposition</mark>:
	like $n^2 odd \rightarrow n \ odd$ Statement 
	$n \ even \rightarrow n^2 odd$ contrapositive
		$n \ odd \rightarrow n^2 \ odd$

Proof by  <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cotradction</mark>

prove $\alpha$ by show  $\neg  \alpha$
is impossible


Proof by cases (Proof by exhaustion )

Like spliting natural into odd and even 






## Counter Example 

Only show a single one that is false 






EX28 Rignt answer :
$\neg \forall x \forall y ( G(x) \land G(y) \rightarrow same(x,y)$)
