# Binary Relation 

Definition: 
  
A binary relation is a mathematical concept that describes a relationship between two elements of a set. More formally, a binary relation on a set A is a subset of the Cartesian product A×A, which is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are elements of A.

In other words, a binary relation is a collection of pairs of elements from a set, where each pair represents a certain relationship or property. The elements in the pairs are ordered, meaning that the order in which they appear matters.

A binary relation on set �A is often denoted by �R and is defined as a set of ordered pairs:

## Reflexivity, Symmetry, Transitivity 

==N.B.==
### Transitivity 
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">What if no a, b, c satisfy a R b ∧ b R c?</mark>
If a relation has no pairs that join up, then it is following the
condition for being transitive.

### Empty Relation
The empty relation on any set is transitive
– because there are no pairs of arrows that can be joined up.
The empty relation is symmetric because you can’t find any arrows
at all.
The empty relation on the empty set is reflexive,
but the empty relation on any non-empty set is not reflexive.

## Not having Relation 
1. To show a relation is not transitive you only need to find one pair
of arrows that can be joined up which do not have a corresponding
single arrow tracing the same route. 
2. And to show a relation is not symmetric you only need to find a
single arrow, the reversal of which is not also in the relation.
3. not reflexive: find a single element that is not related to itself.
	These are all properties of the relation as a whole
	– they do not apply to arrows (pairs) individually.
