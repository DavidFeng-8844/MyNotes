Engineers should indeed care about the impact their work has on animals. The ethical considerations of engineering extend beyond just human-centric concerns. The impact of technological advancements and engineering projects on the environment, including wildlife, is substantial. Whether it's the construction of infrastructure, development of new technologies, or any other engineering endeavor, there is a potential for significant consequences on animal habitats, ecosystems, and individual animals. Engineers must know the effect of anthropogenic climate change, global warming, and carbon emissions. Understanding the nuances of correlation and causation in environmental impact is crucial. Acknowledging the scientific consensus on climate change becomes paramount for ethical engineering practices.

There are several reasons why engineers should care:

Ethical Responsibility: Engineers, like any professionals, have an ethical responsibility to consider the broader consequences of their work. This includes minimizing harm to animals and promoting sustainability.

Ecological Balance: Animals play crucial roles in maintaining ecological balance. Disrupting their habitats or causing harm to specific species can have cascading effects on entire ecosystems.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Many countries have environmental regulations that require considerations for wildlife and ecosystems. Engineers must adhere to these regulations to ensure legal compliance.

Public Perception: As awareness of environmental issues, including animal welfare, grows, the public is increasingly holding companies and professionals accountable for their impact on the planet. Ignoring animal welfare concerns can lead to reputational damage.

Exercises 3.2 
At this point take some time to reflect on the information that you have just read.

Do you think that animals have intrinsic or instrumental value? Why?
Do you think that a version of speciesism can be justified? If so, which one and why?

Write down your answers in your personal learning blog.

Intrinsic or Instrumental Value:

Animals can be seen to have both intrinsic and instrumental value. Intrinsic value refers to value for its own sake, while instrumental value refers to being valuable as a means to an end.

Intrinsic Value: Animals, like any sentient beings, can be argued to have intrinsic value as they possess the capacity to experience pleasure, pain, and a range of emotions. This value exists irrespective of their usefulness to humans.

Instrumental Value: Animals also have instrumental value as they contribute to various ecosystems, agriculture, research, companionship, and more. They serve as instruments or means to achieve certain human goals.

Speciesism:
Speciesism, the discrimination against individuals based on their species, is a complex ethical issue. While some argue for the inherent value of all sentient beings, others may justify a certain level of speciesism based on characteristics like intelligence or self-awareness.

Justified Speciesism: Some may argue that a certain level of speciesism is justified based on ethical frameworks that prioritize certain attributes like higher cognitive abilities or moral agency. For example, giving priority to humans in certain contexts could be justified based on these criteria.
It's important to note that these reflections are not universal, and opinions on animal rights and ethics can vary widely. It's a nuanced and ongoing conversation that involves considerations from philosophy, ethics, biology, and environmental science.

	Gist: The text discusses the field of conservation technology, its evolution, challenges, and the shift towards purpose-driven technology. It emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations, effective communication, and community engagement in developing successful conservation tools. The term 'conservation technology' faces criticism for implying advanced technologies, leading the authors to propose 'conservation tools' as a more inclusive term. The concept of human-wildlife-centered design (HWCD) is introduced, emphasizing collaboration with indigenous communities. The manuscript serves as a guide to those new to the field and includes a glossary of terms used in conservation technology.

	üìù **Summary:**
	The text emphasizes that there is a strong scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, contrary to the perception of uncertainty perpetuated by some policymakers and media. It highlights the alignment of major scientific bodies, such as the IPCC, National Academy of Sciences, American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in affirming human influence on climate change. ==The author conducts an analysis of 928 scientific papers, revealing that 75% explicitly or implicitly support the consensus view, with none opposing it.==

	üìå **Highlights:**
	- üåê **Scientific Consensus:** The text underscores the robust consensus among scientific bodies, including the IPCC, National Academy of Sciences, American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and AAAS.
	- üìä **Analysis of Scientific Papers:** Out of 928 analyzed scientific papers between 1993 and 2003, 75% support the consensus position on anthropogenic climate change, with none explicitly rejecting it.
	- üß™ **Lack of Scientific Disagreement:** Contrary to public perception, the analysis indicates that scientists in peer-reviewed literature overwhelmingly support the idea of human-induced climate change.
	- ü§ù **Cross-Disciplinary Agreement:** The alignment of various scientific disciplines, from climate science to paleoclimatology, supports the consensus, dispelling notions of significant dissent.
	- üö´ **Contradiction of Public Perception:** The text challenges the misconception of widespread disagreement among climate scientists, emphasizing the importance of heeding the scientific consensus for effective climate action.

	3. What is speciesism?
	O Horta - Journal of agricultural and environmental ethics, 2010 - Springer
	üìù **Summary:**
	This paper addresses the moral exclusion of nonhuman animals, focusing on the conceptual framework of speciesism and anthropocentrism. It defines speciesism as unjustified disadvantageous treatment based on species and rejects the notion of different kinds of speciesism. The concept of anthropocentrism is examined and refuted, identifying it as a speciesist view. The paper navigates through various perspectives on discrimination, moral consideration, and anthropocentrism, providing a nuanced exploration of these ethical issues.

	üìå **Highlights:**
	- üêæ **Speciesism Definition:** ==Unjustified disadvantageous treatment based on species classification.==
	- üö´ **Rejecting Speciesism Categories:** Dispels the idea of different kinds of speciesism, emphasizing its core concept.
	- üåç **Anthropocentrism Refutation:** Examines and rejects anthropocentrism, categorizing it as a speciesist view.
	- ü§î **Discrimination Perspectives:** Explores diverse views on discrimination, moral consideration, and anthropocentrism.
	- üìö **Literature Context:** References various works on the topic, acknowledging the complexity and debates within the field.
