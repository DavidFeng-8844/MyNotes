## Kinds of data 

* Numerical Data 
* Textual Data
* Logical Data 

## Numbering System 

> A numbering system assigns meaning to the position of the numeric symbols 

## Binary system 


>Binary is base 2 and has 2 digitals. A collection of n bits has 2npossible states.

## Bit, Bytes, and Words

- Bit- Binary Digital (0 or 1)
- Byte - 8 bits
- Word - the number of bits a processor can process(read/write); ==It is 32/64 bits in most systems==

## Converting 
### Binary to Decimal 

Example:
Every digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. For example if we were working with the binary number ‘00001101” we could convert it to decimal with that chart:

## Hexadecimal

>Def:
>It uses 16 different symbols, the numbers 0 through 9, and the letters ==A through F==. Each symbol represents four bits.
>

>Pros: save memory

### From base 16 to Binary 
Each hexadecimal digit translates into four binary digits

## Octal Number 

### Octal to Binary 
|Each octal digital to a 3-bit binary

### Binary to Octal
Group the binary bits into sets of 3 (because 23= 8). You may need to pad with leading zeros
