## Structure of Von Neumann Machine
•
The von Neumann machine is based on==four linked components:== 
•
==Main memory== which can store programs alongside data.
•
==An Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)== capable of operating on binary data.
•
A ==control unit==which interprets instructions in memory and executes them.
•
==Input and output equipment ==operated by the control unit

## The bus 

## Dee Moore's Law 
==Double== (every 18-24 months):
•The ==number== of transistors per chip
• Computer performance : ==higher packing density means shorter electrical paths,== giving higher performance
• CPU ==clock speed==
• ==power and cooling requirements== are reduced (until 2013)
• One of the above, at ==constant cost== (until 2016)

## Dennard Scaling

Dennard (1974) observed that ==voltage and current should be proportional to the linear dimensions of a transistor==
•Therefore, as transistors shrank, so did required voltage and current
•power is ==proportional to the area of the transistor.==
