## Harvard Architecture 

Memory not store in the same place, so that the hardware can protect the data and avoid safety issues 

## Von Neuman Concepts 
* Data and instructions are both stored in the main memory
* Content of the memory is addressable by location 
* Instruction are addressed sequentially

## Programming
* Configure the hardware to carry out a specific task 
* Made up of ==instructions==*
## Computer Components

> CPU
> Component:
> 1. Control Unit (an instruction interpreter)
> 2. ALU Arithmetic and logic Unit (execute general purpose functions)
> 3. ![[L4-1.png]]

>>>Registers 

>> Control Unit 
>> e.x. fetch pc execute 


* Instruction Resiter IR 
* PC program counter 
* AC Accumulator 

## Interrupts

### Multiple interrupts

Priority: lower priority interrupts can be interrupted by the higher prioritized ones
