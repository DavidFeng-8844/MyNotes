	In the field of computer graphics we study optimisation problems in in domains including crowd animation, mechanical mechanisms, and urban environments. We approach these problems with optimisation techniques ranging from deep learning to integer programming.
		
	Our work in ==scientific visualization==, deals largely with numeric data, for example from climate simulation, geophysical surveys or medical scanners. In contrast, our information visualization research is concerned with discrete or symbolic data, for example relational databases, biological networks, or web logs. Recent visualization applications include computational topology, graphical interfaces, including large scale displays for navigating through data, as well as systems and software for exploration and analysis of large datasets.
	
	Scientific computation In the Scientific Computation group:
	 we apply advanced modelling techniques and numerical algorithms to represent and solve complex, real-world problems in industry and nature, with an emphasis on overall performance and efficient scaling when deployed on massively parallel architectures. We collaborate broadly across the University and beyond, with many successful multi-disciplinary projects spanning mechanical engineering to microbiology.

	 The Algorithms and Complexity theme is led by Professor Kristina Vušković. Research within the theme includes graph theory, logic and model theory, combinatorial optimisation, scheduling theory, algorithms on graphs and data structures, the computational complexity of problems on discrete structures, randomized algorithms, probabilistic analysis of algorithms and approximation algorithms.

==Def==: Scientific visualization refers to the practice of producing graphical representations of scientific phenomena as a means of gaining understanding and insight into the data.

4. Computer vision and computer graphics are two distinct fields within computer science, each focusing on different aspects of visual information processing. Here are the key differences between computer vision and computer graphics: Definition: Computer Vision: Computer vision is concerned with enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves tasks such as image recognition, object detection, scene understanding, and image analysis. Computer Graphics: Computer graphics, on the other hand, involves the creation, manipulation, and representation of visual images and animations using computers. It includes tasks such as 3D modeling, rendering, and animation.
