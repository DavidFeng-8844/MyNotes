## Accessibility

During the heuristic analysis I divided my observation in 5 categories:
LEARNABILITY: how easy is for the users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design;
EFFICIENCY: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks? 
		==The learnability of Strava is of top range. The main action, record a new activity, immediately jumps to the eye.==
		
MEMORABILITY: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
		The recording icon is in the central-bottom, which is very Obvious
ERRORS: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from an error? 
	==Some user forget to stop recording 
SATISFACTION: How pleasant is it to use the design? 
And I give a mark between 0 and 6

## Stakeholders 

We were discussing what we could do in the internet space and spoke to some web developers. There was no javascript let alone GPS and the concept of a dynamically rendered webpage did not exist. The folks we spoke to about this couldn’t wrap their heads around building a site like this. ==What we were talking about was building a combination of a social network and a quantified self-site before there were even terms like that. 
									-- Michael Horvath: Co-founder and CEO of Strava==



### Current Situation 

Fast forward to 2022 and Strava is surpassing 100 million users, becoming a household name in cycling and running communities, receiving a $1.5 billion valuation, and having over two-thirds of the Tour de France riders uploading their results to the platform. There’s even a saying: “If it’s not Strava, it didn’t happen.”


A rather late unicorn, Strava became a >$1bn business in 2020 in light of the pandemic sports craze. The growth is still solid as the company reports to gain over 1 million users a month, estimating to reach the [100 million mark](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/strava-statistics/) anytime in 2023 and expanding its current leadership as the world’s largest social fitness app.


### Useful Transition 

But this insurmountable growth didn’t happen without Strava taking measures to expand, serve their users’ needs and release features that will take it into the years to come. In this article, we will explore just some of the approaches that Strava employs in order to stay relevant in a health and wellness-conscious market.

## Development Path 

### Expanding User base 

1. ==Expanding the features== Initially, Strava was created for cycling and typically for the more professional kind. Today, they boast 31 different activity types on the app, from running to canoeing to rock climbing to alpine skiing.
2. The company’s growth can also be attributed to the impact of the coronavirus. Co-founder Michael stated that “In the last two years, we’ve seen a tremendous shift in the importance of movement and sport in people’s lives."
3. Social Aspects :
	From those who dabble in exercise to those who do it professionally, posting to platforms like Instagram, ==Twitter and Tik Tok has become as much of a habit as a pre-workout stretch or putting on your activewear. ==Strava had always planned to be a social platform, but in the early days, it was very limited in its sharing capacity. In 2017, with a recently appointed CEO and former VP of Instagram, they introduced posts, allowing users to upload photos, questions, comments and tips in a familiar format. By familiar, I mean that this feature is similar to other social media that users generally interact with.
		1. We all know that social media can have a dark side and how trolling and negativity can have devastating impacts. It defers a lot of people from sharing aspects of their lives, and sometimes sharing your workouts and activity can be a daunting task. In a bid to create a safe, encouraging space, Strava only allow you to ‘react’ with Kudos. According to Strava’s support blog, Kudos are a quick thumbs-up you can give to your fellow athletes to congratulate them on a noteworthy activity, achievement, post, badge, or challenge milestone.![[Pasted image 20231107094321.png|400]]
		2. Comments underneath my workouts, ==rides or runs fall into two categories: congratulatory or encouraging.== You can type out a description of how your exercise went without fear of some troll jumping in with something negative. It genuinely feels like we’re all helping to motivate each other without exception. Nathan Irvine
		3. ==It is all about community== Strava have proven that they are so much more than just a news feed. During the pandemic they worked to build community through online clubs and challenges that anyone could join and work toward by logging their activity on the app. In the words of Michael, users began to “look for community and connection when they couldn’t find it through their regular life.”
			1. Group challenges( You can join any group with open permission like NYRR and sometimes they have virtual plague for finishing  a Race)
			2. Distance and Altitude Challenge 
			3. Photo challenge ![[Pasted image 20231107094807.png|400]]
		4.Leader Board
