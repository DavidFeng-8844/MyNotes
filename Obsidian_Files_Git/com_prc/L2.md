## Some Questions 

Electrons can easily flow from the P type base to the
N type collector as long as the base emitter junction
is forward ==biased (base is at a higher voltage than
the emitter).==

The NPN transistor is designed to pass electrons
from the emitter to the collector, subject to the
current present at the base. (I remember the current runs the opposite direction to the electron)

# FET (Field Effect Transistors )
are another type of transistor that has comparable behaviour as Transistor 

and it is more efficient
